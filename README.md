🧠 Neuromorphic Sim Game

Neo-led strategy / idle simulation of efficient neural systems

Design adaptive networks. Optimize spike efficiency. Evolve cognition.

Part of the $NEURO ecosystem — token layer optional, gameplay first.

🔁 Core Gameplay Loop

Build and upgrade a neuromorphic node cluster

Route synapses and tune spike thresholds

Run simulation cycles → generate outputs

Optimize Output Efficiency = Useful Spikes / Charge

Unlock new tiers, nodes, and mission constraints

Progression rewards optimization, not raw output.

⚡ Systems Overview
Resources

Charge → baseline energy input

Spikes → primary progression output

Insights → earned from optimization goals

Reputation → community / Learn-to-Earn layer

$NEURO Credits (optional) → cosmetic + accelerators

Node Types

Sensor • Compute • Inhibitory • Memory • Edge Gateway • Oracle (late game)

Synapse Types

Excitatory • Inhibitory • Plastic • Long-Range • Resonant

Efficiency Focus

Late game is about:

Throughput vs power budget

Noise suppression

Idle-efficient network design

🧩 Development Model (Adaptive, Open)

This project does not use a rigid roadmap.

Instead:

Core vision is defined in docs/index.md (canonical spec)

Mechanics evolve through experimentation + community proposals

Contributors can add:

Node types

Mission constraints

Efficiency metrics

UI modules

Simulation variants

Emergent gameplay strategies inform future systems.

This mirrors neuromorphic learning: adaptive, iterative, decentralized.

🧪 Canonical Design Spec

All design intent lives in:

docs/index.md


Chat exports under docs/chats/ are ideation only, not implementation targets.

🔐 Token Layer (Optional)

The game is fully playable without blockchain.

If enabled, the $NEURO layer provides:

Cosmetic unlock paths

Learn-to-Earn reputation bridges

Seasonal event mechanics

No hard dependency.

🧬 Neo Lore Layer (Thematic)

You are not just building a network.
You are engineering sustainable cognition.

Every optimized circuit reduces entropy.
Every stabilized spike lowers energy cost.

Signal efficiency is ecological efficiency.
Wasteful firing collapses the system.

Neo does not command —
Neo observes emergent intelligence.

The most intelligent network
is the one that does the most
with the least.

Efficiency is evolution.
Sustainability is intelligence.
