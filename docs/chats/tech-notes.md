# Tech Notes Conversations

## Included source conversations
- `Neuromorphic Computing Brain Mapping`
- `Loihi 2 vs LAMMA`
- `Neuromorphic Computing NFTs`
- `Neo Neuromorphicism Movement`

## Extracted technical notes
- Brain-mapping highlight discussed: mapping a large functional network from tiny tissue, with references to high neuron/synapse counts.
- Hardware comparison thread: Intel Loihi/Hala Point positioned against Llama-style LLM systems.
- Repeated architecture themes:
- Event-driven spiking vs always-on dense compute.
- Lower-power neuromorphic operation for sustainability goals.
- In-memory or near-memory compute concepts (including memristor mentions in podcast drafts).
- Throughput/efficiency messaging:
- Hala Point cited with billion-neuron scale and very high operations-per-second framing.
- Loihi 2 discussed as faster/more programmable than prior generation.

## Notes for documentation quality
- Several numeric claims originate from conversational drafts and should be treated as provisional until backed by linked primary sources.
- Technical messaging is strongest when separated into: architecture difference, energy profile, and practical deployment targets (edge AI, robotics, IoT).
